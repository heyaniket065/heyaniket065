      overview:
        "A character-driven edit designed as a study in pacing: how far rhythm alone can carry attention when the visual language stays consistent.",
      challenge:
        "Edits in this space compete on effects. The challenge was to stand out through structure and timing rather than adding more.",
      research:
        "Reviewed how the track builds tension, where its silences fall, and which visual beats a viewer anticipates before they arrive.",
      strategy: "Lock the cut to the music's own architecture, then remove any effect that does not serve a beat.",
      direction: "High contrast, limited palette, hard cuts, typography used sparingly as punctuation.",
      execution: [

      strategy: "Anchor every episode in one principle, supported by one concrete example and one honest limitation.",
